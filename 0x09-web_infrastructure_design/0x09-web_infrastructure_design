 essential elements : 
1. Improved infrastructure with additional server and load balancer for better performance, scalability, and redundancy.
2. HAproxy with Round Robin for load balancing and active-active/passive setup for optimal performance and failover.
3. Database setup with Primary (Master) for writes and Replica (Slave) for reads and failover.
4. App writes to Primary node; reads can use Primary or Replica for better performance and redundancy.
5. Issues: Single Point of Failure with primary database, security risks due to lack of firewall and HTTPS, and monitoring challenges.
