  essential components : 
1. Server: A powerful computer that hosts our website. 
2. Web Server (Nginx): Software that manages user requests and serves web pages. 
3. Application Server: Software that processes code to create dynamic website content. 
4. Application Files (Codebase): Collection of code files that define website functionality.
 5. Database (MySQL): Software that stores website data.
 6 .Domain Name (foobar.com): User-friendly name for the website. "www" DNS Record: Points to the server's IP address (A record).

Issues with this Infrastructure:

1 - Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Everything relies on one server.
    If the server crashes, the website goes down.
2 - Downtime during Maintenance: Restarting the web server
    (e.g., deploying new code) can cause temporary downtimefor the website.
3 - Limited Scalability: This setup struggles with high traffic volumes.
    The single server might not be able to handle a surge in user requests.
